# Notely Project

Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) 👋

Create an application that allows users to manage their tasks with notes.

## How to start

1. Start the project in our [app](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/projects/notely) to get a feel for it.
2. Review the requirements listed below in this README.
3. Go through the design assets on the [project's page](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/projects/notely) to understand the project more.
4. Clone this repository or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to set up the project environment.
5. Choose your preferred technology stack and overwrite repository files as needed to set up your project structure. We included a few files and the `assets` folder for convenience, extracted from the design.
6. Begin coding, either using the Freerun mode to work on each card individually or the Speedrun mode to work at your own pace. Be sure to follow the guidelines outlined below.
7. Have a strong desire to learn and improve your skills as a Big Developer. 🚀

## Requirements

- [ ] Add navigation with a placeholder search and an "+ Add" button.
- [ ] Implement a dialog to add a new note with title, description, and category fields. The date should be created under the hood using the current date.
- [ ] Display all created notes with their details and a colored label, sorted by date.
- [ ] Implement a dialog to edit notes.
- [ ] Implement a dialog to delete notes.
- [ ] Allow users to mark notes as completed, moving them to the end and strikethrough text.
- [ ] Implement searching notes by title.
- [ ] Implement filtering notes by category with tabs.
- [ ] Add a "Show only completed notes" checkbox.
- [ ] Visualize empty states with proper illustration and text.
- [ ] Validate the title field as required and the description field as a maximum of 200 characters.
- [ ] Save notes using e.g. local storage to keep persistency on browser refresh.

## Guidelines

1. Aim for pixel-perfect implementation of the design. Use tools like [PixelParallel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob?hl=en) or other techniques to ensure accuracy.
2. Write clean and efficient code. Use extensions like [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for formatting and errors, and consider using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.
3. Follow a [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). Keep your commits small and descriptive, organize your work into separate branches, and use pull requests for code reviews.

Remember, the cleaner and more accurate your code is, the faster you can finish and the better you'll feel about your work.
So let's make it happen! 💡

## Submitting project

Once you've completed the project and unlocked the Submit step in our app, it's time to deploy your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (if you haven't done so already). Keep in mind that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file, and we'll check for it when you submit your Project URL. So don't forget to include it! You'll also need to provide the project title and the primary frontend technology used. Good luck!

## We're in Beta and getting better every day!

Hey there, Big Developer! We wanted to take a moment to thank you for participating in our project and helping us improve our platform. We're always looking for ways to make our app better, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to let us know.

Happy coding! 🚀
