# Task
Your task is to build a Notes Application as presented in the design under the Notes project section in BigDevSoon. The project is about managing your personal, home, business (or all) notes! Implement adding, editing, deleting, and marking notes as completed. There are also additional features to cover such as searching and filtering. üë®‚Äçüíª

## Prerequisites
You can choose any technologies of your own preference, the same applies to any tools, libraries, frameworks and everything related. We want you to have fun building this project and composing a technology stack that plays well with your taste.

## Requirements

- [ ] Notes App UI matches the design and all of the UI states are implemented.
- [ ] When adding a new note, users can fill title, category, and description. The date should be created under the hood using the current date.
- [ ] Users can see created notes with all details and a colored label, sorted by date.
- [ ] Users can mark notes as completed, edit, and delete them.
- [ ] Users can search and filter notes.
- [ ] When completing notes, they should have strikethrough text and become grayed out. Also, they should be moved into the end.
- [ ] When editing notes, the date of the note should also be updated altogether with other fields.
- [ ] When deleting notes confirmation should pop up.
- [ ] Where needed, validation should be added.
- [ ] All the empty states are visualized with proper illustration and text.
- [ ] Save and read notes, using e.g. localStorage.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! üòä
